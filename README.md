**How to run:**
- There you’ll see a file naming “config.env” under the folder “config”.
- Insert your own Google OAuth and MongoDB URI credentials on it.
- Back to the root folder, open up Terminal/Command Prompt/Git Bash -> Install all the dependencies: npm install
- Then, after completion -> npm run dev to run the server in development mode and npm start for production mode.
- Open your favorite browser and head over to “http://127.0.0.1:3000/”
